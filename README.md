# Fallen Alphabet

> ???

To be honest with you... I am not even sure why I picked this name...

In any case, this game is quite rage-inflicting.

In addition, we are actually not sure if it is possible to beat the game

## How to play?

You control the ball, and the goal is to *fly* (more like do some really unconventional stuff) pass 50 obstacles.

If you succeed, the game keeps on running, so keep count yourself!

If you don't, the game restarts with a new set of 50 different obstables.

You are only allowed to jump (or double jump) with `X`,

Increase the gravity on the ball with `Z`,

Or temporary slow down and even rewind the scene with `Shift`.
Note that if you hold `Shift` for too long, you get penalized and the game ignores it for the reset of the game :trollface: .

## How to build?

Build with `./gradlew assemble` or `./gradlew run` to run the game.
